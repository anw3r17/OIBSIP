Task 2 of Oasis Byte Internship. 
## Number Guessing Gamme
This is a basic, fun and extremely easy task where in which the user has to guess the number which has been generated randomly by the Computer within a limited number of attempts.
The code consists of a Scanner class "s", a Random Variable class called "rand", an integer used to store the randomly generated integer called "crand".


## The code utilizes:


The Scanner instance s for user input.

The Random instance rand to generate a random integer between 1 and 100, stored in crand.

A for loop to control the number of attempts, up to a maximum of 10, to check if the user's guess matches the generated number.


## How to Play:
1. The game prompts the user to enter a guess.
2. After each guess, feedback is provided to help the user adjust their next guess.
3. If the user guesses the correct number, they win, and a victory message is displayed.
4. If 10 attempts are exhausted without a correct guess, the game reveals the number and ends.
